Accelerometers and drag free sensors were\\nand remain at the core of geodesy, aeronomy, and precision navigation missions\\nas well as gravitational science experiments and gravitational wave\\nobservatories. Charge management using photoelectrons generated by the 254 nm\\nUV line of Hg was first demonstrated on Gravity Probe B and is presently part\\nof the LISA Pathfinder technology demonstration. The UV LED mission and prior\\nground testing demonstrates that AlGaN UV LEDs operating at 255 nm are superior\\nto Mercury vapor lamps because of their smaller size, lower draw, higher\\ndynamic range, and higher control authority. We show flight data from a small\\nsatellite mission on a Saudi Satellite that demonstrates AC charge control (UV\\nLEDs and bias are AC modulated with adjustable relative phase) between a\\nspherical test mass and its housing. The result of the mission is to bring the\\nUV LED device Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to TRL 9 and the charge\\nmanagement system to TRL 7. We demonstrate the ability to control the test mass\\npotential on an 89 mm diameter spherical test mass over a 20 mm gap in a drag\\nfree system configuration. The test mass potential was measured with an ultra\\nhigh impedance contact probe. Finally, the key electrical and optical\\ncharacteristics of the UV LEDs showed less than 7.5 percent change in\\nperformance after 12 months in orbit.\\n\",\n          \"  We endow the set of probability measures on a weighted graph with a\\nMonge--Kantorovich metric, induced by a function defined on the set of\\nvertices. The graph is assumed to have $n$ vertices and so, the boundary of the\\nprobability simplex is an affine $(n-2)$--chain. Characterizing the geodesics\\nof minimal length which may intersect the boundary, is a challenge we overcome\\neven when the endpoints of the geodesics don't share the same connected\\ncomponents. It is our hope that this work would be a preamble to the theory of\\nMean Field Games on graphs.\\n\",\n          \"  We present a randomized polynomial-time algorithm to generate a random\\ninteger according to the distribution of norms of ideals at most N in any given\\nnumber field, along with the factorization of the integer. Using this\\nalgorithm, we can produce a random ideal in the ring of algebraic integers\\nuniformly at random among ideals with norm up to N, in polynomial time.

Combined\\nwith proper weight initialization, this alleviates the need for normalization\\nlayers. We explore the training of deep vanilla recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) with up to 144 layers, and show that bipolar activation functions help\\nlearning in this setting. On the Penn Treebank and Text8 language modeling\\ntasks we obtain competitive results, improving on the best reported results for\\nnon-gated networks. In experiments with convolutional neural networks without\\nbatch normalization, we find that bipolar activations produce a faster drop in\\ntraining error, and results in a lower test error on the CIFAR-10\\nclassification task.\\n\",\n          \"  We introduce the \\\"NoBackTrack\\\" algorithm to train the parameters of dynamical\\nsystems such as recurrent neural networks. This algorithm works in an online,\\nmemoryless setting, thus requiring no backpropagation through time, and is\\nscalable, avoiding the large computational and memory cost of maintaining the\\nfull gradient of the current state with respect to the parameters.\\n  The algorithm essentially maintains, at each time, a single search direction\\nin parameter space. The evolution of this search direction is partly stochastic\\nand is constructed in such a way to provide, at every time, an unbiased random\\nestimate of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.\\nBecause the gradient estimate is unbiased, on average over time the parameter\\nis updated as it should.\\n  The resulting gradient estimate can then be fed to a lightweight Kalman-like\\nfilter to yield an improved algorithm. For recurrent neural networks, the\\nresulting algorithms scale linearly with the number of parameters.\\n  Small-scale experiments confirm the suitability of the approach, showing that\\nthe stochastic approximation of the gradient introduced in the algorithm is not\\ndetrimental to learning. In particular, the Kalman-like version of NoBackTrack\\nis superior to backpropagation through time (BPTT) when the time span of\\ndependencies in the data is longer than the truncation span for BPTT.\\n\",\n          \"  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success for cognitive\\napplications. The core operation in a DNN is the dot product between quantized\\ninputs and weights. Prior works exploit the weight/input repetition that arises\\ndue to quantization to avoid redundant computations in Convolutional Neural\\nNetworks (CNNs). However, in this paper we show that their effectiveness is\\nseverely limited when applied to Fully-Connected (FC) layers, which are\\ncommonly used in state-of-the-art DNNs, as it is the case of modern Recurrent\\nNeural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models.\\n  To improve energy-efficiency of FC computation we present CREW, a hardware\\naccelerator that implements Computation Reuse and an Efficient Weight Storage\\nmechanism to exploit the large number of repeated weights in FC layers. CREW\\nfirst performs the multiplications of the unique weights by their respective\\ninputs and stores the results in an on-chip buffer. The storage requirements\\nare modest due to the small number of unique weights and the relatively small\\nsize of the input compared to convolutional layers. Next, CREW computes each\\noutput by fetching and adding its required products. To this end, each weight\\nis replaced offline by an index in the buffer of unique products. Indices are\\ntypically smaller than the quantized weights, since the number of unique\\nweights for each input tends to be much lower than the range of quantized\\nweights, which reduces storage and memory bandwidth requirements.\\n  Overall, CREW greatly reduces the number of multiplications and provides\\nsignificant savings in model memory footprint and memory bandwidth usage. We\\nevaluate CREW on a diverse set of modern DNNs. On average, CREW provides 2.61x\\nspeedup and 2.42x energy savings over a TPU-like accelerator. Compared to UCNN,\\na state-of-art computation reuse technique, CREW achieves 2.10x speedup and\\n2.08x energy savings on average.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.09055606702823853,\n        \"min\": 0.5855400437691198,\n        \"max\": 0.801783725737273,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.7171371656006361,\n          0.5855400437691198,\n          0.6236095644623236\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
